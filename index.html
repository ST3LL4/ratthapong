                <h2>The Reunion Day</h2>
                <p>Slowly the first satellites were sent back into orbit, and contact was reestablished. In 149 AL the
                    pioneers of Antares established regular contact with one another, marking the first Reunion Day — a
                    holiday celebrated annually across the Confederacy. The reunification was bittersweet, as not
                    every colony had prospered, of the 19 original settlements, only 11 had survived. Of the fallen 8: 2
                    had starved, 4 had succumbed to disease, 1 had frozen, 1 had flooded, while the fate of the last was
                    sealed. Among the surviving sites, the level of success varied considerably. A few nations had just
                    barely managed to survive and would be reliant on outside help to truly thrive. Others had developed
                    into one or sometimes several nation states.</p>

                <h2>Liberation of Earth</h2>
                <p>Across the Intisar System, enormous structures were perpetually lit by thousands of glowing engines
                    as fleets of construction vessels moved tirelessly to complete the new center of the Antares
                    Military Industrial Complex. A site from which the liberation of Earth could be launched and
                    coordinated. The Confederacy was united and driven by the ideal that “Evil must be Opposed." And
                    with every year came renewed accounts of the atrocities and carnage that the United Terran
                    Protectorates and their Screk masters had unleashed upon the galaxy. Far across the frontier, the
                    horrors first unleashed upon the Thimodian Republic were repeated. Entire worlds were encased within
                    unbreakable fields of energy at the direction of the Screk. Any who resisted were crushed.</p>

                <h2>Last Stand of Discovery Square</h2>
                <p>Priority was placed on capturing Reyes to the point that the final defensive positions at Discovery
                    Plaza held by the 1077th tank regiment and other elements was captured rather than bombarded in an
                    attempt to seize her, despite her unreported death well before then. The Khan himself commemorated
                    the Confederate defenders in Discovery Plaza by naming ships after their soldiers, including a
                    battleship named Lilliana Reyes of Antares. The heroic defense of the 1077th tank regiment
                    became legendary in the Confederacy, and among the Baanthurians.</p>
